We are trying to write data science --> artificial intelligence (AI) --> machine learning (ML) algorithms from scratch!

1st: We take it easy and simple! 

2nd: We could see examples and excess information in my website : https://bakhshiali.com/skills/artificial-intelligence/

List of implementations :
* Linear Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Means
* Mean-Shift
